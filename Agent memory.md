Memory for an agent is something that we provide via context in the prompt

1 - Episodic 

containing past interactions of the agent. The application would store the action in some kind of persistent storage. Like storing semantic meaning of interactions in  vector database. For example
storing the user query asked, generated sql, any feedback from the user

Also store agents Confidence Score: The agent's confidence in the generated query or the expected outcome.
Persistent storage: it cannot live in the immediate conversation window but has to be a persistent storage. meaning available even if the agent restarts fully. 

2 - Semantic - Any external information that is available to the agent and any knowledge the agent should have about itself. You can think of this as a context similar to one used in RAG applications. 
It can be internal knowledge only available to the agent or a grounding context to isolate part of the internet scale data for more accurate answers.

3 - Procedural - This is systemic information like the structure of the System Prompt, available tools, guardrails etc. It will usually be stored in Git, Prompt and Tool Registries.

ùü±. All of the information pulled together from the long-term or stored in local memory is called short-term or working memory. 
Compiling all of it into a prompt will produce the prompt to be passed to the LLM and it will provide further actions to be taken by the system.
